			<p><i>Thanks to kht for contributing to this section.</i></p>

		<div class="bfv-sym-info-subheader">Spread Increase</div>
			<p>Spread is applied per-shot (spread increase per shot, or “SIPS”), as it has been in previous <i>Battlefield</i> titles. Spread decreases even when the gun is not idle (see: in between shots while firing at max rate of fire), decreasing at an accelerating rate per frame.</p>
			<p><i>- Spread exponent:</i> Dictates rate of spread decrease acceleration<br>
			<i>- Spread offset:</i> Fixed value for spread decrease per frame<br>
			<i>- Spread coefficient:</i> Beta for spread decrease acceleration</p>
			<p>\[
				\text{spread}_n \; = \; \text{spread}_{n-1} - \frac{1}{\text{simrate}} \cdot (\text{coef} \cdot (\text{spread}_{n-1} - \text{minspread})^\text{exp} + \text{offset})
			\]</p>
			<p><i>Note: "n" designates the current frame, of which current spread is calculated, simrate = Battlefield 2042's logic loop of 45hz</i></p>
			<p>This new system for spread decrease results in a spread curve that is vaguely logarithmic, with diminishing spread penalties for further sustained fire. ADS (zoomed) spread uses uniform distribution over radius, which features an inner bias. Hipfire uses a uniform distribution over the area meaning that shots are distributed evenly throughout the area of the spread cone.</p>
		
		<div class="bfv-sym-info-subheader">Idle Spread Decrease</div>
			<p>In <i>Battlefield 2042,</i> idle spread decrease is non-linear due to spread decrease offset values of zero.	
			The spread decrease offset effectively sets the number of degrees of spread decreased per frame, where the idle time dictates the number of frames after a shot is figured that must be surpassed before the idle spread decrease rates are used. 
			Idle spread decrease is only in consideration for transitions in movement or firing state (ADS/zoomed to hipfire/unzoomed), or very slowly pacing/tapfiring shots.
			</p>
			<p> 
			Compared to <i>Battlefield V,</i> spread decrease will not scale as aggressively thanks to having an exponent of 1 and an offset of 0. 
			Instead, it is largely dependent on a given weapon's coefficient value.
			</p>
		<div class="bfv-sym-info-subheader">Vertical and Horizontal Recoil</div>
			<p>As with all <i>Battlefield</i> games since <i>Battlefield 1</i>, vertical recoil is a fixed (non-randomized) value. 
			While vertical recoil can accelerate, the increases and decreases are at discrete, known intervals. 
			Horizontal recoil works as it always had in previous games, consisting of a number line (e.g. -0.3 to 0.3), where a randomly generated value is produced, with a uniform distribution.
			</p>
		<div class="bfv-sym-info-subheader">Initial Recoil Multipliers</div>	
			<p><i>Battlefield 2042</i> has introduced an additional recoil system, to be called Initial Recoil Multipliers (IRM). 
			IRM, when present, provides a set of multipliers to be applied, in order, to an amount of rounds fired from a weapon equal to the amount of multipliers provided. 
			IRM can be applied to both HRec and VRec separately. 
			</p>
			<hr style="width:50%;text-align:center">
			<p><i>For example, say IRM provides a weapon, with the recoil values of 0.5 up, 0.15 left, and 0.2 right, the multipliers of:</i></p>
			<pre style="display:inline">VRec = [1.8, 1.5, 1.3, 1.1, 1.0]</pre>
			<br>
			<pre style="display:inline">HRec = [1.2, 1.2, 0.8, 0.8, 1.1]</pre>
			<br>
			<p><i>The resulting recoil for the first five shots of this weapon would be:</i></p>
			<pre style="display:inline">Up:&nbsp; &nbsp; 0.90, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55, 0.5</pre>
			<br>
			<pre style="display:inline">Left:&nbsp; 0.18, 0.18, 0.12, 0.12, 0.165</pre>
			<br>
			<pre style="display:inline">Right: 0.24, 0.24, 0.16, 0.16, 0.22</pre>
			<br>
			<br>
			<i>Not only is each of these five shots unique to one another, but all are different compared to the base values of the weapon.</i>
			<hr style="width:50%;text-align:center">
			<p>It should be stated that not all weapons have IRM. 
			Those that do have IRM may differ in IRM severity and duration compared to other weapons. 
			Even within the same weapon, IRM may not have the same amount of values (or values at all) for both VRec and HRec.
			</p>
		<div class="bfv-sym-info-subheader">Recoil Decrease</div>
			<p>Recoil decrease works as it does since <i>Battlefield 1</i>, persisting even when the gun is not idle, and decelerates as time passes.</p>
