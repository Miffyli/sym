		<p>Well here it is, the big "soon" project. <i>Call of Duty: Warzone</i> is coming to Sym.gg. This has been a <i><b>massive</i></b> undertaking by everyone here at Sym, though I'd particularly like to shout-out Robenter and new face ExaltedVanguard. Robenter's continued expertise and continued efforts in bringing the data to life
		</p>
		<p>Now then, after much anticipation, <i>Battlefield 2042</i> weapon data is now live.  
		As is tradition, the weapon charts will display basic information, while the comparison page will get into the nitty-gritty, including the variety of attachments that <i>Battlefield 2042</i> has brought to the table compared to previous <i>Battlefield</i> games. 
		Support will continue on the <i>Battlefield 2042</i> pages so long as EA DICE continues to the support the game itself, so expect future content added and tweaks made over time.
		</p>
		<p>With the majority of the work related to <i>Battlefield 2042</i> behind us, the team here at sym.gg will be undertaking a new project that we hope to share very soon with everyone.

		<p>A huge amount of appreciation and thanks must be given to both <a href="https://twitter.com/robenter/" target="_blank">Robenter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Miffyli" target="_blank">Miffyli</a> for setting aside much of their limited free time to improving the site and adding the latest <i>Battlefield</i> to its pages. 
		This could not have been done without either of their efforts. Also an additional special shoutout to <b>txt</b>, a new face whose knowledge and willingness to help cannot be understated.
		</p>
		<p>Happy new year everyone, and until next time,</p>
		<p>- Incarnate</p>
