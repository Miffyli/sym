		<p>Well here it is, the big "soon" project - <i>Call of Duty: Warzone</i> has come to Sym.gg. 
		While several <i>Call of Duty</i> games had been featured on the old symthic.com, <i>Call of Duty</i> now makes a triumphant return to Sym with a new page style and an abundance of data. Gunsmith-esque weapon builder, precise statistical breakdowns, and charts to the heart's content. Sym.gg now hosts the most accurate and in-depth <i>Call of Duty: Warzone</i> data available, and all for free! 
		</p>
		<p>This has been a <i><b>massive</i></b> undertaking by everyone here at Sym, though I'd particularly like to shout-out <a href="https://twitter.com/robenter/" target="_blank">Robenter</a> and new face, <a href="https://twitter.com/ExaltedVanguard" target="_blank">ExaltedVanguard</a>. 
		Robenter's continued expertise and continued efforts in bringing the data to life cannot be understated, so please send him your thanks should you spot him on Twitter or the <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/Z9vcu46" target="_blank">Sym Discord.</a>. 
 		Then enter ExaltedVanguard, whose knowledge within the realm of Call of Duty gave this project the foundation it needed to get started. 
		His understanding of the game and its inner-workings is what guarantees the site's peerless accuracy. 
		A huge thanks to both these individuals, as none of this would have been possible without their hard work. There were many others that also contributed while developing and testing these pages as well, and their efforts cannot be understated. 
		</p>
		<p>Be sure to follow Sym.gg on <a href="https://twitter.com/Symthic/" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, and until next time,</p>
