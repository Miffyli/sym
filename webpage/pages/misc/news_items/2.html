		<p>One of the most popular requests now fulfilled, <i>Battlefield 1</i>'s weapon charts have made their glorious return to the web. 
		A big thanks to Robenter who put in the effort to make these charts happen, so if you seem him around, be sure to show him some love.</p>
		<p>With <i>Battlefield 1</i> formally up on sym.gg, our focus will be turned to additional previous DICE titles such as <i>Battlefield 4</i> and <i>Battlefield 3.</i> 
		That said, another common request we hear is the desire to cover weapon data for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. 
		While we too are interested in covering this title, at this moment we unfortunately do not have the means to datamine weapon stats for this game. 
		If anyone has the this ability or knows someone with the ability to accomplish this, please reach out to us via the <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/Z9vcu46" target="_blank">Sym Discord.</a></p>
		<p>Lastly, with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affecting many around the world, we hope that everyone remain safe and healthy during this chaotic time.  There will be plenty of game stats to look at on the other side.</p>
		<p>Until next time,</p>
		<p>- Incarnate</p>
