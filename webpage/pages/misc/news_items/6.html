		<p>To bring in the new year and a new <i>Battlefield</i> game, we first wanted to touch up the site to make navigation easier than before, while also accommodating both <i>Battlefield 2042</i> and additional future titles. 
		Basic site information is still available between the headers and the footers, however the new hamburger button will allow navigation to any game and any of its pages. 
		We hope this change will make moving around the site much quicker and cleaner. 
		</p>
		<p>Now then, after much anticipation, <i>Battlefield 2042</i> weapon data is now live.  
		As is tradition, the weapon charts will display basic information, while the comparison page will get into the nitty-gritty, including the variety of attachments that <i>Battlefield 2042</i> has brought to the table compared to previous <i>Battlefield</i> games. 
		Support will continue on the <i>Battlefield 2042</i> pages so long as EA DICE continues to the support the game itself, so expect future content added and tweaks made over time.
		</p>
		<p>With the majority of the work related to <i>Battlefield 2042</i> behind us, the team here at sym.gg will be undertaking a new project that we hope to share very soon with everyone. 
		To provide feedback on the site, or to stay up-to-date with our next endeavor, join the <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/Z9vcu46" target="_blank">Sym Discord.</a> 
		Following our <a href="https://twitter.com/symthic" target="_blank">Twitter</a> is another great way to stay in the loop.
		</p>
		<p>A huge amount of appreciation and thanks must be given to both <a href="https://twitter.com/robenter/" target="_blank">Robenter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Miffyli" target="_blank">Miffyli</a> for setting aside much of their limited free time to improving the site and adding the latest <i>Battlefield</i> to its pages. 
		This could not have been done without either of their efforts. Also an additional special shoutout to <b>txt</b>, a new face whose knowledge and willingness to help cannot be understated.
		</p>
		<p>Happy new year everyone, and until next time,</p>
		<p>- Incarnate</p>
