		<p>A twinge late on this news post, but we would like to take a moment to celebrate the initial launch of Sym.gg support for <i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</i>. 
		This immense task was undertaken primarily by <a href="https://twitter.com/ExaltedVanguard" target="_blank">ExaltedVanguard</a>, so be sure to show some love should you spot him on Twitter or the <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/Z9vcu46" target="_blank">Sym Discord</a>. 
		</p>
		<p>Further work is currently being done to expand from just base weapon data, though like all unfolding endeavors there are new things to learn. Attachments and Warzone 2.0 data coming soonâ„¢.
		Be sure to follow Sym.gg on <a href="https://twitter.com/Symthic/" target="_blank">Twitter</a> for the latest updates, and until next time,</p>
		<p>- The Sym staff</p>
