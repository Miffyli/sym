		<p>Working our way through the classic <i>Battlefield</i> titles on the Frostbite engine, <i>Battlefield 3</i> is the next legacy title to see its weapon charts and comparison page return to Sym. 
		As other backlogged titles are completed, they will added to the site.</p>
		<p>Like always, thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/robenter/" target="_blank">Robenter</a> for creating the weapon charts, and also to <a href="https://github.com/Miffyli" target="_blank">Miffyli</a> for creating the comparison page and tangling with the attachment modifiers.
		Expect to see further legacy titles returning in the near future.</p>
		<p>Until next time,</p>
		<p>- Incarnate</p>
