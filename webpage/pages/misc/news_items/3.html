		<p>Working our way through the classic <i>Battlefield</i> titles on the Frostbite engine, <i>Battlefield 3</i> is the first legacy title to see its weapon charts and comparison page return to Sym. 
		For those interested, all the <i>Battlefield 3</i> pages can be found under the <a href="https://sym.gg/?game=other&page=index" target="_blank">"Other Titles"</a> page. 
		Current intentions with this page have it being where all older titles will find their homes. 
		As other backlogged titles are completed, or as current titles fall out of popular interest, they will added or moved to the "Other Titles" page.</p>
		<p>Like always, thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/robenter/" target="_blank">Robenter</a> for creating the weapon charts, and also to <a href="https://github.com/Miffyli" target="_blank">Miffyli</a> for creating the comparison page and tangling with the attachment modifiers.
		Expect to see further legacy titles returning in the near future.</p>
		<p>Until next time,</p>
		<p>- Incarnate</p>
