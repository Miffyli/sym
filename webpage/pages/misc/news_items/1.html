		<p>It’s been almost a year, but Symthic is back with a fancy new domain.  What you will find is a more refined symthic.com, hosting the same data straight from the game files as we have always done.  Please take a look around the site, and if you have any questions or feedback, let us know via the Sym Discord.</p>
		<p>So, what is next for sym.gg?  Although we have launched with <i>Battlefield V</i> (and a light offering of <i>Battlefield 1</i>), refinement of the <i>Battlefield</i> pages will be an ongoing process, due to both user feedback and <i>Battlefield V</i>’s own Tides of War progression which will be adding new items to the game for the near future.  Expect to see previous other <i>Battlefield</i> titles reappear on the site over time as well. To provide feedback or comments, use our Discord.</p>
		<p>Outside of <i>Battlefield,</i> we are currently working on data for <i>Apex Legends,</i> a popular battle royale set in the <i>Titanfall</i> universe.  Additionally, thanks to a poll that many individuals completed, we know that current interests for Sym going forward lie in the <i>Call of Duty, Rainbow Six, SW:Battlefront,</i> and <i>Titanfall</i> franchises.  However, time and experience are limiting factors, and we cannot accomplish everything we would like to in a brief period of time.  Therefore, we are happy to announce that sym.gg will become an open-source endeavor, so if you or anyone you know has experience extracting data from these franchises, and would also be willing to help add these titles to sym.gg, please get in contact with us!</p>	
		<p>Lastly, before wrapping this up, I want to personally thank both Miffyli and Robenter for their amazing work toward getting sym.gg up and running. Bringing back Sym could not have been possible without their time and effort, which they generously donated from their own free time.  Seriously, thank you for all of your effort, expertise, and dedication throughout the last three months of development.</p>
		<p>That said, on behalf of all the site’s staff, we hope you enjoy the new sym.gg!</p>
