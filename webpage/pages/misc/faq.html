	<h2>Can I use your information in my personal [Youtube video, Wiki post, etc..]?</h2>
		<p>Certainly!  Perhaps one of the largest goals for sym.gg is to help stop the spread of misinformation by providing game data <i>exactly </i> as the files store it.  By referencing our data, you're using 100% accurate information, and that's great!<br><br>

		However, because game data is liable to change, and because people are often curious as to where the data comes from, we ask that you reference this site in your content so that others may find it.  Whether this be something in the description of a video or a hyperlink in a text post, <b><u>as long as you link back to sym.gg in a clearly visible location</u>,</b> we're good with it!</p>

	<h2>How do you obtain the data? Is it accurate?</h2>
		<p>Obtaining game data can vary greatly from title to title, and often is a time-consuming process that is much too lengthy to describe in a brief FAQ - especially when you want to present the data as we do here on this site. We do our best to ensure that the data we gather is accurate, and do our best to avoid human errors along the way. Should we ever slip-up, we'll try to correct the error as soon as it's brought to our attention.
		<br><br>As an extension of this line of thought, do not expect to see any unreleased information on this site. While leaking can be exciting for a community, it is more often than not a detriment to the game and its developers.</p>

	<h2>"X" game just came out - could you add it to the site?</h2>
		<p>Like stated above, obtaining game data can vary greatly from title to title, and is often a time-consuming process. That said, if there is substantial interest in a particular game then doing so is not unreasonable.  Join the Sym Discord and talk with the staff to see if it's an option!</p>

	<h2>I'm having a hard time understanding a particular part of game data - what can I do?</h2>
		<p>This happens all the time, and to everyone.  If you're looking for a quick answer, there's usually any number of community members available on the Sym Discord, and a few of them may just have the answer you're looking for.

	<h2>What's a Sym?</h2>
		<p>As the story goes, Symthic was actually a person with a personal server and the <i>Battlefield 3</i> game data back in 2011.  With the personal server reaching its limits, Symthic grabbed the symthic.com domain to keep it simple, and Symthic became the website's name.  When we transfered to sym.gg we decided to keep our roots, but decided to go by what the community called us - "Sym."<br>
		<br>	
		In short, Sym is a nickname, a person, and the best website to find accurate game data!<br>For more information, check the "About" page.</p>

	<h2>What happened to symthic.com?</h2>
		<p>On January 11th, 2019, Curse, who hosted the webpages, archived the site, preventing the ability to add more pages or make new posts.  While it would have been possible to simply rehost the site, we wanted to avoid any potential legal issues associated with doing so.  Because of this, symthic.com will remained archived and all future data is posted here. 

	<h2>I don't see a particular title previously featured on symthic.com - where is it now?</h2>
		<p>Due to the site's fresh start, data for previously featured titles will be added slowly over time from scratch, based on both demand and a franchise's reverse chronological order.  This is to say that for example, <i>Battlefield 4</i> would be added before <i>Battlefield 3,</i> and <i>Call of Duty: Ghosts</i> would be unlikely to make a return apperance due to lack of interest.
