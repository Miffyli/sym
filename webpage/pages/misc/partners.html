	<h1>Nitrado</h1>
		<p>A world-leading game server and application hosting provider with locations across the globe, Nitrado supports a vast array of games and applications, all with a bevy of options at an affordable price.  Renting one of their high-end severs also comes with 24/7 customer support and customized DDoS Protection, just in case things get messy.<br>
		<br>
		Sym has been partnered with Nitrado since <i>Battlefield 4,</i> and they have provided our community and our team with top-quality voice and game servers.  When we hosted the <i>Battlefield 4</i> CCS League from 2015 to 2016, Nitrado supported us, ready to provide servers for matches and as prizes. Without them CCS would not have had the same level of success that it was able to achieve.<br>
