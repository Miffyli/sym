	<h2>Can I use your information in my personal [Youtube video, Reddit post, etc..]?</h2>
		<p>Certainly!  Perhaps one of the largest goals for sym.gg is to help stop the spread of misinformation by providing game data <i>exactly </i> as the files store it.  By referencing our data, you're using 100% accurate information, and that's great!<br>
		<br>However, because game data is liable to change, and because people are often curious as to where the data comes from, we ask that you reference this site in your content so that others may find it.  Whether this be something in the description of a video or a hyperlink in a text post, <b><u>as long as you link somewhere back to sym.gg in a clearly visable location</u>,</b> <br>we're good with it!</p>

	<h2>What's a Sym?</h2>
		<p>As the story goes, Symthic was actually a person with a personal server and the BF3 game data back in 2011.  With the personal server reaching its limits, Symthic grabbed the symthic.com domain to keep it simple, and Symthic became the website's name.  When we transfered to sym.gg we decided to keep our roots, but decided to go by what the community called us - "Sym." <br>
		<br> In short, Sym is a nickname, a person, and the best website to find accurate game data!</p>
