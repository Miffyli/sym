	<h2>History</h2>
		<p>The original symthic.com was founded in november 2011.  Before that Symthic was Sym's nick, and the website was his private website meant for his friends and personal projects.  When he got his hands on the BF3 data and published the first weapon charts on the public part of the website, it got a new meaning in a few days. Other things moved and symthic became a BF3 weapon stats-website.<br>
		<br>The website was very basic and poorly polished with simple BF3 damage chart-images and other general information.  It was hosted on Sym's old broken laptop from his home and worked behind the url symthic.dy.fi.  It didn't take long til the traffic grew too much for the laptop to handle and we moved to a real webhost and obtained the domain symthic.com.  <i>That's</i> how Symthic was born.<br>
		<br>A few weeks later, the Symthic forum was created and it quickly became the place for BF3 data enthusiasts.  Later, during the summer of 2013, Symthic was sold to Curse Inc., but nothing changed development-wise.  Multiple games were published on the site, such as BF4, BFH, BF1, CoD: Ghosts, Titanfall, and SW:BF<br>
		<br>In the fall of 2018, the original symthic.com was archived, and all development ceased.  <i>However</i> work transitioned to sym.gg after purchasing the domain, and the first true version of the new site went live in September 2019 thanks to the hard work of a few developers!
