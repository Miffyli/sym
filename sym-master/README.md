# Sym
Towards more open-source Symthic/Sym pages ( https://sym.gg/ )

Traditionally offers information on game mechanics and weapon stats of Battlefield games. 

## Guidelines

* Javascript should be written according to [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/)
* For HTML5 follow [W3School's HTML5 style guide](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp)
* Git commit messages should be done in [imperative commit-style](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3580764/2867076).
* Site should be light on the server, thus things should be done on Javascript. Server just serves
  static files, javascripts and any databases in JSON files.

## TODOs

* New BFV/BF1 pages for charts and "multi-comparison"
